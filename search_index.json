Introduction to Modern CMake","keywords":"","body":"An Introduction to Modern CMake\nPeople love to hate build systems.\nJust watch the talks from CppCon17 to see examples of developers making the state of build systems the brunt of jokes.\nThis raises the question: Why?\nCertainly there are no shortage of problems when building.\nBut I think that, in 2020, we have a very good solution to quite a few of those problems.\nIt's CMake. Not CMake 2.8 though; that was released before C++11 even existed!\nNor the horrible examples out there for CMake (even those posted on KitWare's own tutorials list).\nI'm talking about Modern CMake. CMake 3.1+, maybe even CMake 3.19+!\nIt's clean, powerful, and elegant, so you can spend most of your time coding, not adding lines to an unreadable, unmaintainable Make (Or CMake 2) file.\nAnd CMake 3.11+ is supposed to be significantly faster, as well!\nThis book is meant to be a living document. You can raise an issue or put in a merge request on GitLab.\nYou can also download a copy as a PDF. Be sure to check the [HSF CMake Training][], as well!\n\nIn short, here are the most likely questions in your mind if you are considering Modern CMake:\nWhy do I need a good build system?\nDo any of the following apply to you?\n\nYou want to avoid hard-coding paths\nYou need to build a package on more than one computer\nYou want to use CI (continuous integration)\nYou need to support different OSs (maybe even just flavors of Unix)\nYou want to support multiple compilers\nYou want to use an IDE, but maybe not all of the time\nYou want to describe how your program is structured logically, not flags and commands\nYou want to use a library\nYou want to use tools, like Clang-Tidy, to help you code\nYou want to use a debugger\n\nIf so, you'll benefit from a CMake-like build system.\nWhy must the answer be CMake?\nBuild systems is a hot topic. Of course there are many options. But even a really good one, or one that re-uses a familiar syntax, can't come close to CMake.\nWhy?\nSupport.\nEvery IDE supports CMake (or CMake supports that IDE).\nMore packages use CMake than any other system.\nSo, if you use a library that is designed to be included in your code, you have a choice: Make your own build system, or use one of the provided ones, and that will almost always include CMake.\nAnd that will quickly be the common denominator if you include multiple projects.\nAnd, if you need a library that's preinstalled, the chances of it having a find CMake script or config CMake script are excellent.\nWhy use a Modern CMake?\nAround CMake 2.6-2.8, CMake started taking over. It was in most of the package managers for Linux OS's, and was being used in lots of packages.\nThen Python 3 came out.\nI know, this should have nothing whatsoever to do with CMake.\nBut it had a 3.\nAnd it followed 2.\nAnd it was a hard, ugly, transition that is still ongoing in some places, even today.\nI believe that CMake 3 had the bad luck to follow Python 3.1\nEven though every version of CMake is insanely backward compatible, the 3 series was treated as if it were something new.\nAnd so, you'll find OSs like CentOS7 with GCC 4.8, with almost-complete C++14 support, and CMake 2.8, which came out before C++11.\nYou really should at least use a version of CMake that came out after your compiler, since it needs to know compiler flags, etc, for that version.\nAnd, since CMake will dumb itself down to the minimum required version in your CMake file, installing a new CMake, even system wide, is pretty safe.\nYou should at least install it locally.\nIt's easy (1-2 lines in many cases), and you'll find that 5 minutes of work will save you hundreds of lines and hours of CMakeLists.txt writing, and will be much easier to maintain in the long run.\nThis book tries to solve the problem of the poor examples and best practices that you'll find proliferating the web.\nOther sources\nOther material from the original author of this book:\n\nHSF CMake Training\nInteractive Modern CMake talk\n\nThere are some other places to find good information on the web. Here are some of them:\n\nThe official help: Really amazing documentation. Nicely organized, great search, and you can toggle versions at the top. It just doesn't have a great \"best practices tutorial\", which is what this book tries to fill in.\nEffective Modern CMake: A great list of do's and don'ts.\nEmbracing Modern CMake: A post with good description of the term\nIt's time to do CMake Right: A nice set of best practices for Modern CMake projects.\nThe Ultimate Guide to Modern CMake: A slightly dated post with similar intent.\nMore Modern CMake: A great presentation from Meeting C++ 2018 that recommends CMake 3.12+. This talk makes calls CMake 3.0+ \"Modern CMake\" and CMake 3.12+ \"More Modern CMake\".\nOh No! More Modern CMake: The sequel to More Modern CMake.\ntoeb/moderncmake: A nice presentation and examples about CMake 3.5+, with intro to syntax through project organization\n\nCredits\nModern CMake was originally written by Henry Schreiner. Other contributors can be found listed on GitLab.\n\n1. CMake 3.0 also removed several long deprecated features from very old versions of CMake and make one very tiny backwards incompatible change to syntax related to square brackets, so this is not entirely fair; there might be some very, very old CMake files that would stop working with 3. I've never seen one, though. ↩\n\n"},"chapters/intro/installing.html":{"url":"chapters/intro/installing.html","title":"Installing CMake","keywords":"","body":"Installing CMake\nYour CMake version should be newer than your compiler. It should be newer than the libraries you are using (especially Boost). New versions work better for everyone.\n\nIf you have a built in copy of CMake, it isn't special or customized for your system. You can easily install a new one instead, either on the system level or the user level. Feel free to instruct your users here if they complain about a CMake requirement being set too high. Especially if they want 3.1+ support. Maybe even if they want 3.19+ support...\nQuick list (more info on each method below)\nOrdered by author preference:\n\nAll\nPip (official, sometimes delayed slightly)\nAnaconda / Conda-Forge\n\n\nWindows\nChocolatey\nScoop\nMSYS2\nDownload binary (official)\n\n\nMacOS\nHomebrew\nMacPorts\nDownload binary (official)\n\n\nLinux\nSnapcraft (official)\nAPT repository (Ubuntu/Debian only) (official)\nDownload binary (official)\n\n\n\nOfficial package\nYou can download CMake from KitWare. This is how you will probably get CMake if you are on Windows. It's not a bad way to get it on macOS either, but using brew install cmake is much nicer if you use Homebrew (and you should). You can also get it on most other package managers, such as Chocolatey for Windows or MacPorts for macOS.\nOn Linux, there are several options. Kitware provides a Debian/Ubunutu apt repository, as well as snap packages. There are universal Linux binaries provided, but you'll need to pick an install location. If you already use ~/.local for user-space packages, the following single line command1 will get CMake for you 2:\n~ $ wget -qO- \"https://cmake.org/files/v3.19/cmake-3.19.0-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz\" | tar --strip-components=1 -xz -C ~/.local\n\nIf you just want a local folder with CMake only:\n~ $ mkdir -p cmake-3.19 && wget -qO- \"https://cmake.org/files/v3.19/cmake-3.19.0-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz\" | tar --strip-components=1 -xz -C cmake-3.19\n~ $ export PATH=`pwd`/cmake-3.19/bin:$PATH\n\nYou'll obviously want to append to the PATH every time you start a new terminal, or add it to your .bashrc or to an LMod system.\nAnd, if you want a system install, install to /usr/local; this is an excellent choice in a Docker container, for example on GitLab CI. Do not try it on a non-containerized system.\ndocker $ wget -qO- \"https://cmake.org/files/v3.19/cmake-3.19.0-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz\" | tar --strip-components=1 -xz -C /usr/local\n\nIf you are on a system without wget, replace wget -qO- with curl -s.\nYou can also build CMake on any system, it's pretty easy, but binaries are faster.\nCMake Default Versions\nHere are some common build environments and the CMake version you'll find on them. Feel free to install CMake yourself, it's 1-2 lines and there's nothing \"special\" about the built in version. It's also very backward compatible.\nWindows\n\n\n\nAlso Scoop is generally up to date. The normal installers from CMake.org are common on Windows, too.\nMacOS\n\n\n\nHomebrew is quite a bit more popular nowadays on macOS, at least according to Google Trends.\nLinux\nRHEL/CentOS\n\n\n\nThe default on 8 is not too bad, but you should not use the default on 7. Use the EPEL package instead.\nUbuntu\n\n\n\n\nYou should only use the default CMake on 18.04+; it's an LTS release with a pretty decent minimum version!\nOther\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral tools\n\n\n\n\nJust pip install cmake on many systems. Add --user if you have to (modern pip does this for you if needed).\nCI\n\n\n\nDistribution\nCMake version\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nTravisCI Xenial\n3.12.4\nMid November 2018 this image became ready for widescale use.\n\n\nTravisCI Bionic\n3.12.4\nSame as Xenial at the moment.\n\n\nAzure DevOps 18.04\n3.17.0\n\n\n\nGitHub Actions 18.04\n3.17.0\nMostly in sync with Azure DevOps\n\n\nGitHub Actions 20.04\n3.17.0\nMostly in sync with Azure DevOps\n\n\n\nIf you are using GitHub Actions, also see the jwlawson/actions-setup-cmake action, which can install your selection of CMake, even in a docker action run.\nFull list\nVersions less than 3.10 are marked by a deeper color of red.\n\nAlso see pkgs.org/download/cmake.\nPip\nThis is also provided as an official package, maintained by the authors of CMake at KitWare. It's a rather new method, and might fail on some systems (Alpine isn't supported last I checked, but that has a recent CMake), but works really well when it works (like on Travis CI). If you have pip (Python's package installer), you can do:\ngitbook $ pip install cmake\n\nAnd as long as a binary exists for your system, you'll be up-and-running almost immediately. If a binary doesn't exist, it will try to use KitWare's scikit-build package to build, which currently can't be listed as a dependency in the packaging system, and might even require (an older) copy of CMake to build. So only use this system if binaries exist, which is most of the time.\nThis has the benefit of respecting your current virtual environment, as well. It really shines when placed in a pyproject.toml file, however - it will only be installed to build your package, and will not remain afterwords! Fantastic.\nPersonally, on Linux, I put versions of CMake in folders, like /opt/cmake312 or ~/opt/cmake312, and then add them to [LMod][]. See envmodule_setup for help setting up an LMod system on macOS or Linux. It takes a bit to learn, but is a great way to manage package and compiler versions.\n\n\n1. I assume this is obvious, but you are downloading and running code, which exposes you to a man in the middle attack. If you are in a critical environment, you should download the file and check the checksum. (And, no, simply doing this in two steps does not make you any safer, only a checksum is safer). ↩\n\n\n2. If you don't have a .local in your home directory, it's easy to start. Just make the folder, then add export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\" to your .bashrc or .bash_profile or .profile file in your home directory. Now you can install any packages you build to -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local instead of /usr/local! ↩\n\n"},"chapters/intro/running.html":{"url":"chapters/intro/running.html","title":"Running CMake","keywords":"","body":"Running CMake\nBefore writing CMake, let's make sure you know how to run it to make things. This is true for almost all CMake projects, which is almost everything.\nBuilding a project\nUnless otherwise noted, you should always make a build directory and build from there. You can technically do an in-source build, but you'll have to be careful not to overwrite files or add them to git, so just don't.\nHere's the Classic CMake Build Procedure (TM):\n~/package $ mkdir build\n~/package $ cd build\n~/package/build $ cmake ..\n~/package/build $ make\n\nYou can replace the make line with cmake --build . if you'd like, and it will call make or whatever build tool you are using. If you are using a newer version of CMake (which you usually should be, except for checking compatibility with older CMake), you can instead do this:\n~/package $ cmake -S . -B build\n~/package $ cmake --build build\n\nAny one of these commands will install:\n# From the build directory (pick one)\n~/package/build $ make install\n~/package/build $ cmake --build . --target install\n~/package/build $ cmake --install . # CMake 3.15+ only\n\n# From the source directory (pick one)\n~/package $ cmake --build build --target install\n~/package $ cmake --install build # CMake 3.15+ only\n\nSo set of methods should you use? As long as you do not forget to type the build directory as the argument, staying out of the build directory is shorter, and making source changes is easier from the source directory. You should try to get used to using --build, as that will free you from using only make to build. Note that working from the build directory is historically much more common, and some tools and commands (including CTest) still require running from the build directory.\nJust to clarify, you can point CMake at either the source directory from the build directory, or at an existing build directory from anywhere.\nIf you use cmake --build instead of directly calling the underlying build system, you can use -v for verbose builds (CMake 3.14+), -j N for parallel builds on N cores (CMake 3.12+), and --target (any version of CMake) or -t (CMake 3.15+) to pick a target. Otherwise, these commands vary between build systems, such as VERBOSE=1 make and ninja -v.\nPicking a compiler\nSelecting a compiler must be done on the first run in an empty directory. It's not CMake syntax per se, but you might not be familiar with it. To pick Clang:\n~/package/build $ CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake ..\n\nThat sets the environment variables in bash for CC and CXX, and CMake will respect those variables. This sets it just for that one line, but that's the only time you'll need those; afterwards CMake continues to use the paths it deduces from those values.\nPicking a generator\nYou can build with a variety of tools; make is usually the default. To see all the tools CMake knows about on your system, run\n~/package/build $ cmake --help\n\nAnd you can pick a tool with -G\"My Tool\" (quotes only needed if spaces are in the tool name). You should pick a tool on your first CMake call in a directory, just like the compiler. Feel free to have several build directories, like build/ and buildXcode.\nYou can set the environment variable CMAKE_GENERATOR to control the default generator (CMake 3.15+).\nNote that makefiles will only run in parallel if you explicilty pass a number of threads, such as make -j2, while Ninja will automatically run in parallel. You can directly pass a parallelization option such as -j2 to the cmake --build . command in recent versions of CMake.\nSetting options\nYou set options in CMake with -D. You can see a list of options with -L, or a list with human-readable help with -LH. If you don't list the source/build directory, the listing will not rerun CMake (cmake -L instead of cmake -L .).\nVerbose and partial builds\nAgain, not really CMake, but if you are using a command line build tool like make, you can get verbose builds:\n~/package/build $ VERBOSE=1 make\n\nYou can actually write make VERBOSE=1, and make will also do the right thing, though that's a feature of make and not the command line in general.\nYou can also build just a part of a build by specifying a target, such as the name of a library or executable you've defined in CMake, and make will just build that target.\nOptions\nCMake has support for cached options. A Variable in CMake can be marked as \"cached\", which means it will be written to the cache (a file called CMakeCache.txt in the build directory) when it is encountered. You can preset (or change) the value of a cached option on the command line with -D. When CMake looks for a cached variable, it will use the existing value and will not overwrite it.\nStandard options\nThese are common CMake options to most packages:\n\n-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE= Pick from Release, RelWithDebInfo, Debug, or sometimes more.\n-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= The location to install to. System install on UNIX would often be /usr/local (the default), user directories are often ~/.local, or you can pick a folder.\n-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS= You can set this ON or OFF to control the default for shared libraries (the author can pick one vs. the other explicitly instead of using the default, though)\n-DBUILD_TESTING= This is a common name for enabling tests, not all packages use it, though, sometimes with good reason.\n\nDebugging your CMake files\nWe've already mentioned verbose output for the build, but you can also see verbose CMake configure output too. The --trace option will print every line of CMake that is run. Since this is very verbose, CMake 3.7 added --trace-source=\"filename\", which will print out every executed line of just the file you are interested in when it runs. If you select the name of the file you are interested in debugging (usually by selecting the parent directory when debugging a CMakeLists.txt, since all of those have the same name), you can just see the lines that run in that file. Very useful!\n"},"chapters/intro/dodonot.html":{"url":"chapters/intro/dodonot.html","title":"Do's and Don'ts","keywords":"","body":"Do's and Don'ts\nCMake Antipatterns\nThe next two lists are heavily based on the excellent gist Effective Modern CMake. That list is much longer and more detailed, feel free to read it as well.\n\nDo not use global functions: This includes link_directories, include_libraries, and similar.\nDon't add unneeded PUBLIC requirements: You should avoid forcing something on users that is not required (-Wall). Make these PRIVATE instead.\nDon't GLOB files: Make or another tool will not know if you add files without rerunning CMake. Note that CMake 3.12 adds a CONFIGURE_DEPENDS flag that makes this far better if you need to use it.\nLink to built files directly: Always link to targets if available.\nNever skip PUBLIC/PRIVATE when linking: This causes all future linking to be keyword-less.\n\nCMake Patterns\n\nTreat CMake as code: It is code. It should be as clean and readable as all other code.\nThink in targets: Your targets should represent concepts. Make an (IMPORTED) INTERFACE target for anything that should stay together and link to that.\nExport your interface: You should be able to run from build or install.\nWrite a Config.cmake file: This is what a library author should do to support clients.\nMake ALIAS targets to keep usage consistent: Using add_subdirectory and find_package should provide the same targets and namespaces.\nCombine common functionality into clearly documented functions or macros: Functions are better usually.\nUse lowercase function names: CMake functions and macros can be called lower or upper case. Always use lower case. Upper case is for variables.\nUse cmake_policy and/or range of versions: Policies change for a reason. Only piecemeal set OLD policies if you have to.\n\n"},"chapters/intro/newcmake.html":{"url":"chapters/intro/newcmake.html","title":"What's new in CMake","keywords":"","body":"What's new in in CMake\nThis is an abbreviated version of the CMake changlog with just the highlights for authors. Names for each release are arbitrarily picked by the author.\nCMake 3.0 : Interface libraries\nThere were a ton of additions to this version of CMake, primarily to fill out the target interface. Some bits of needed functionality were missed and implemented in CMake 3.1 instead.\n\nInitially released June 10, 2014\nNew documentation\nINTERFACE libraries\nProject VERSION support\nExporting build trees easily\nBracket arguments and comments available (not widely used)\nLots of improvements\n\nCMake 3.1 : C++11 and compile features\nThis is the first release of CMake to support C++11.

Internal changes, like better Windows and UTF8 support, were the focus.\n\nInitially released March 11, 2015\ncontinue() inside loops\nFile and directory locks added\n\nCMake 3.3 : if IN_LIST\nThis is notable for the useful IN_LIST option for if, but it also added better library search using $PATH (See CMake 3.6), dependencies for INTERFACE libraries, and several other useful improvements. The addition of a COMPILE_LANGUAGE generator expression would prove very useful in the future as more languages are added. Makefiles now produce better output in parallel.\n\nInitially released July 23, 2015\nIN_LIST added to if\n*_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE property added\nCOMPILE_LANGUAGE generator expression (limited support in some generators)\n\nCMake 3.4 : Swift & CCache\nThis release adds lots of useful tools, support for the Swift language, and the usual improvements.

Useful new if statement options really help clarify code. And the new server mode was supposed to improve integration with IDEs (but is being replaced by a different system in CMake 3.14+). Support for the VIM editor was also improved.\n\nInitially released November 11, 2016\nPARSE_ARGV mode for cmake_parse_arguments\nBetter 32-bit support on 64-bit machines\nLots of useful new if comparisons, like VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL (really, why did it take this long?)\nLINK_WHAT_YOU_USE added\nLots of custom properties related to files and directories\nCMake Server added\nAdded --trace-source=\"filename\" to monitor certain files only\n\nCMake 3.8 : C# & CUDA\nThis adds CUDA as a language, as well as cxx_std_11 as a compiler meta-feature.

One of the smaller\nbut immediately noticeable changes is the addition of version ranges;\nyou can now set both the minimum and maximum known CMake version easily. You can also set\nCONFIGURE_DEPENDS on a GLOBed set of files, and the build system will check those files and\nrerun if needed! You can use the general PackageName_ROOT\nfor all find_package searches.

Lots of new functions that fill out the\npopular requests for CMake, such as add_link_options, target_link_directories, and\ntarget_link_options. You can now do quite a bit more modification to targets outside\nof the source directory, for better file separation. And, target_sources finally handles relative paths properly (policy 76).\n\nInitially released November 20, 2018\nNew ctest --progress option for live output\ntarget_link_options and add_link_options added\ntarget_link_directories added\nSymbolic link creation, -E create_symlink, supported on Windows\nIPO supported on Windows\nYou can use -S and -B for source and build directories\ntarget_link_libraries and install work outside the current target directory\nSTATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS property added\ntarget_sources is now relative to the current source directory (CMP0076)\nIf you use Xcode, you now can experimentally set schema fields\n\nCMake 3.14 : File utilities (AKA CMake π)\nThis release has lots of small cleanups, including several utilities for files. Generator expressions work in a few more places, and list handling is better with empty variables.\nQuite a few more find packages produce targets. The new Visual Studio 16 2019 generator is a bit different than older versions. Windows XP and Vista support has been dropped.\n\nInitially released March 14, 2019\nThe cmake --build command gained -v/--verbose, to use verbose builds if your build tool supports it\nThe FILE command gained CREATE_LINK, READ_SYMLINK, and SIZE\nget_filename_component gained LAST_EXT and NAME_WLE to access just the last extension on a file, which would get .zip on a file such as version.1.2.zip (very handy!)\nYou can see if a variable is defined in the CACHE with DEFINED CACHE{VAR} in an if statement.\nBUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN and CMake version were added to improve handling of RPath in the build directory.\nThe CMake server mode is now being replaced with a file API, starting in this release. Will affect IDEs in the long run.\n\nCMake 3.15 : CLI upgrade\nThis release has many smaller polishing changes, include several of improvements to the CMake command line, such as control over the default generator through environment variables (so now it's easy to change the default generator to Ninja). Multiple targets are supported in --build mode, and --install mode added. CMake finally supports multiple levels of logging. Generator expressions gained a few handy tools. The still very new FindPython module continues to improve, and FindBoost is now more inline with Boost 1.70's new CONFIG\nmodule. export(PACKAGE) has drastically changed; it now no longer touches $HOME/.cmake by default (if CMake Minimum version is 3.15 or higher), and requires an extra step if a user wants to use it. This is generally less surprising.\n\nInitially released July 17, 2019\nCMAKE_GENERATOR environment variable added to control default generator\nMultiple target support in build mode, cmake . --build --target a b\nShortcut -t for --target\nInstall support, cmake . --install, does not invoke the build system\nSupport for --loglevel and NOTICE, VERBOSE, DEBUG, and TRACE for message\nThe list command gained PREPEND, POP_FRONT, and POP_BACK\nexecute_process gained COMMAND_ECHO option (CMAKE_EXECUTE_PROCESS_COMMAND_ECHO) allows you to automatically echo commands before running them\nSeveral Ninja improvements, include SWIFT language support\nCompiler and list improvements to generator expressions\n\nCMake 3.16 : Unity builds\nA new unity build mode was added, allowing source files to be merged into a single build file. Support for\nprecompiled headers (possibly preparing for C++20 modules, perhaps?) was added. Lots of other smaller\nfixes were implemented, especially to newer features, such as to FindPython, FindDoxygen, and others.\n\nInitially released November 26, 2019\nAdded support for Objective C and Objective C++ languages\nSupport for precompiling headers, with target_precompile_headers\nSupport for \"Unity\" or \"Jumbo\" builds (merging source files) with CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD\nCTest: Can now skip based on regex, expand lists\nSeveral new features to control RPath.\nGenerator expressions work in more places, like build and install paths\nFind locations can now be explicitly controlled through new variables\n\nCMake 3.17 : More CUDA\nA FindCUDAToolkit was finally added, which allows finding and using the CUDA\ntoolkit without enabling the CUDA language! CUDA now is a bit more configurable,\nsuch as linking to shared libraries. Quite a bit more polish in the expected areas,\nas well, like FindPython. Finally, you can now iterate over multiple lists at a time.\n\nInitially released March 20, 2020\nCUDA_RUNTIME_LIBRARY can finally be set to Shared!\nFindCUDAToolkit finally added\ncmake -E rm replaces older remove commands\nCUDA has meta features like cuda_std_03, etc.\nYou can track the searches for packages with --debug-find\nExternalProject can now disable recursive checkouts\nFindPython better integration with Conda\nDEPRECATION can be applied to targets\nCMake gained a rm command\nSeveral new environment variables\nforeach can now do ZIP_LISTS (multiple lists at a time)\n\nCMake 3.18 : CUDA with Clang & CMake macro language\nCUDA now supports Clang (without separable compilation). A new\nCUDA_ARCHITECTURES property was implemented to better support targeting CUDA\nhardware. A new cmake_language command supports calling cmake commands and\nexpressions from strings. Lots of other meta changes that could make new\ndesigns available; calling functions by variable, evaluating arbitrary CMake by\nstring, and configure files directly from strings. Many other nice tiny\nfeatures and papercut fixes are sprinkled throughout, a small selection is below.\n\nInitially released July 15, 2020\ncmake can cat files together now\nNew profiling mode for cmake\ncmake_language with CALL and EVAL\nexport requires APPEND if used multiple times (in CMake language level 3.18+)\nYou can archive directly from file()\nfile(CONFIGURE is a nicer from of configure_file if you already have a string to produce\nOther find_* commands gain find_package's REQUIRED flag\nNATURAL sorting in list(SORT added\nMore options for handling properties with DIRECTORY scope\nCUDA_ARCHITECTURES was added\nNew LINK_LANGUAGE generator expressions (DEVICE/HOST versions too)\nSource can be a subdirectory for FetchContent\n\nCMake 3.19 : Presets\nYou can now add presets in JSON form, and users will get the preset default.\nfind_package can now take a version range, and some specialty find modules,\nlike FindPython, have custom support for it.  A lot of new controls were added\nfor permissions.

And the value of the version follows the keyword. Like everywhere in\nthis book, just click on the command name to see the official documentation,\nand use the dropdown to switch documentation between CMake versions.\nThis line is special! 2 The version of CMake will also dictate the policies,\nwhich define behavior changes. So, if you set minimum_required to VERSION\n2.8, you'll get the wrong linking behavior on macOS, for example, even in the\nnewest CMake versions. If you set it to 3.3 or less, you'll get the wrong\nhidden symbols behaviour, etc. A list of policies and versions is available at\npolicies.\nStarting in CMake 3.12, this supports a range, such as VERSION 3.1...3.15;\nthis means you support as low as 3.1 but have also tested it with the new\npolicy settings up to 3.15.

If CMake is 3.12 or higher, the if\nblock will be false, but the new syntax in cmake_minimum_required will be\nrespected and this will continue to work properly!\nWARNING: MSVC's CMake server mode originally had a\nbug in reading this format, so if\nyou need to support non-command line Windows builds for older MSVC versions,\nyou will want to do this instead:\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.7)\n\nif(${CMAKE_VERSION} VERSION_LESS 3.19)\n    cmake_policy(VERSION ${CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION}.${CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION})\nelse()\n    cmake_policy(VERSION 3.19)\nendif()\n\nIf you really need to set to a low value here, you can use\ncmake_policy to conditionally increase the policy level or set a\nspecific policy. Please at least do this for your macOS users!\n\nSetting a project\nNow, every top-level CMake file will have the next line:\nproject(MyProject VERSION 1.0\n                  DESCRIPTION \"Very nice project\"\n                  LANGUAGES CXX)\n\nNow we see even more syntax. Strings are quoted, whitespace doesn't matter, and\nthe name of the project is the first argument (positional). All the keyword\narguments here are optional. The version sets a bunch of variables, like\nMyProject_VERSION and PROJECT_VERSION. The languages are C, CXX,\nFortran, ASM, CUDA (CMake 3.8+), CSharp (3.8+), and SWIFT (CMake\n3.15+ experimental). C CXX is the default. In CMake 3.9, DESCRIPTION was\nadded to set a project description, as well. The documentation for\nproject may be helpful.\nYou can add\ncomments\nwith the # character. CMake does have an inline syntax for comments too, but\nit's rarely used.\n\nThere's really nothing special about the project name. No targets are added at this point.\nMaking an executable\nAlthough libraries are much more interesting, and we'll spend most of our time\nwith them, let's start with a simple executable.\nadd_executable(one two.cpp three.h)\n\nThere are several things to unpack here. one is both the name of the executable file generated, and the name of the CMake target created (you'll hear a lot more about targets soon, I promise). The source file list comes next, and you can list as many as you'd like. CMake is smart, and will only compile source file extensions. The headers will be, for most intents and purposes, ignored; the only reason to list them is to get them to show up in IDEs. Targets show up as folders in many IDEs. More about the general build system and targets is available at buildsystem.\nMaking a library\nMaking a library is done with add_library, and is just about as simple:\nadd_library(one STATIC two.cpp three.h)\n\nYou get to pick a type of library, STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE. If you leave this choice off, the value of BUILD_SHARED_LIBS will be used to pick between STATIC and SHARED.\nAs you'll see in the following sections, often you'll need to make a fictional target, that is, one where nothing needs to be compiled, for example, for a header-only library. That is called an INTERFACE library, and is another choice; the only difference is it cannot be followed by filenames.\nYou can also make an ALIAS library with an existing library, which simply gives you a new name for a target. The one benefit to this is that you can make libraries with :: in the name (which you'll see later). 3\nTargets are your friend\nNow we've specified a target, how do we add information about it? For example, maybe it needs an include directory:\ntarget_include_directories(one PUBLIC include)\n\ntarget_include_directories adds an include directory to a target. PUBLIC doesn't mean much for an executable; for a library it lets CMake know that any targets that link to this target must also need that include directory. Other options are PRIVATE (only affect the current target, not dependencies), and INTERFACE (only needed for dependencies).\nWe can then chain targets:\nadd_library(another STATIC another.cpp another.h)\ntarget_link_libraries(another PUBLIC one)\n\ntarget_link_libraries is probably the most useful and confusing command in CMake. It takes a target (another) and adds a dependency if a target is given. If no target of that name (one) exists, then it adds a link to a library called one on your path (hence the name of the command). Or you can give it a full path to a library. Or a linker flag. Just to add a final bit of confusion, classic CMake allowed you to skip the keyword selection of PUBLIC, etc. If this was done on a target, you'll get an error if you try to mix styles further down the chain.\nFocus on using targets everywhere, and keywords everywhere, and you'll be fine.\nTargets can have include directories, linked libraries (or linked targets), compile options, compile definitions, compile features (see the C++11 chapter), and more. As you'll see in the two including projects chapters, you can often get targets (and always make targets) to represent all the libraries you use. Even things that are not true libraries, like OpenMP, can be represented with targets. This is why Modern CMake is great!\nDive in\nSee if you can follow the following file. It makes a simple C++11 library and a program using it. No dependencies. I'll discuss more C++ standard options later, using the CMake 3.8 system for now.\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8)\n\nproject(Calculator LANGUAGES CXX)\n\nadd_library(calclib STATIC src/calclib.cpp include/calc/lib.hpp)\ntarget_include_directories(calclib PUBLIC include)\ntarget_compile_features(calclib PUBLIC cxx_std_11)\n\nadd_executable(calc apps/calc.cpp)\ntarget_link_libraries(calc PUBLIC calclib)\n\n\n1. In this book, I'll mostly avoid showing you the wrong way to do things; you can find plenty of examples of that online. I'll mention alternatives occasionally, but these are not recommended unless they are absolutely necessary; often they are just there to help you read older CMake code. ↩\n\n\n2. You will sometimes see FATAL_ERROR here, that was needed to support nice failures when running this in CMake  ↩\n\n\n3. The :: syntax was originally intended for INTERFACE IMPORTED libraries, which were explicitly supposed to be libraries defined outside the current project. But, because of this, most of the target_* commands don't work on IMPORTED libraries, making them hard to set up yourself. So don't use the IMPORTED keyword for now, and use an ALIAS target instead; it will be fine until you start exporting targets. This limitation was fixed in CMake 3.11. ↩\n\n"},"chapters/basics/variables.html":{"url":"chapters/basics/variables.html","title":"Variables and the Cache","keywords":"","body":"Variables and the Cache\nLocal Variables\nWe will cover variables first. A local variable is set like this:\nset(MY_VARIABLE \"value\")\n\nThe names of variables are usually all caps, and the value follows. You access a variable by using ${}, such as ${MY_VARIABLE}.1  CMake has the concept of scope; you can access the value of the variable after you set it as long as you are in the same scope. If you leave a function or a file in a sub directory, the variable will no longer be defined. You can set a variable in the scope immediately above your current one with PARENT_SCOPE at the end.\nLists are simply a series of values when you set them:\nset(MY_LIST \"one\" \"two\")\n\nwhich internally become ; separated values. So this is an identical statement:\nset(MY_LIST \"one;two\")\n\nThe list( command has utilities for working with lists, and separate_arguments will turn a space separated string into a list (inplace). Note that an unquoted value in CMake is the same as a quoted one if there are no spaces in it; this allows you to skip the quotes most of the time when working with value that you know could not contain spaces.\nWhen a variable is expanded using ${} syntax, all the same rules about spaces apply. Be especially careful with paths; paths may contain a space at any time and should always be quoted when they are a variable (never write ${MY_PATH}, always should\nbe \"${MY_PATH}\").\nCache Variables\nIf you want to set a variable from the command line, CMake offers a variable cache. Some variables are already here, like CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE. The syntax for declaring a variable and setting it if it is not already set is:\nset(MY_CACHE_VARIABLE \"VALUE\" CACHE STRING \"Description\")\n\nThis will not replace an existing value. This is so that you can set these on the command line and not have them overridden when the CMake file executes. If you want to use these variables as a make-shift global variable, then you can do:\nset(MY_CACHE_VARIABLE \"VALUE\" CACHE STRING \"\" FORCE)\nmark_as_advanced(MY_CACHE_VARIABLE)\n\nThe first line will cause the value to be set no matter what, and the second line will keep the variable from showing up in the list of variables if you run cmake -L .. or use a GUI. This is so common, you can also use the INTERNAL type to do the same thing (though technically it forces the STRING type, this won't affect any CMake code that depends on the variable):\nset(MY_CACHE_VARIABLE \"VALUE\" CACHE INTERNAL \"\")\n\nSince BOOL is such a common variable type, you can set it more succinctly with the shortcut:\n option(MY_OPTION \"This is settable from the command line\" OFF)\n\nFor the BOOL datatype, there are several different wordings for ON and OFF.\nSee cmake-variables for a listing of known variables in CMake.\nEnvironment variables\nYou can also set(ENV{variable_name} value) and get $ENV{variable_name} environment variables, though it is generally a very good idea to avoid them.\nThe Cache\nThe cache is actually just a text file, CMakeCache.txt, that gets created in the build directory when you run CMake. This is how CMake remembers anything you set, so you don't have to re-list your options every time you rerun CMake.\nProperties\nThe other way CMake stores information is in properties. This is like a variable, but it is attached to some other item, like a directory or a target. A global property can be a useful uncached global variable. Many target properties are initialized from a matching variable with CMAKE_ at the front. So setting CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD, for example, will mean that all new targets created will have CXX_STANDARD set to that when they are created. There are two\nways to set properties:\nset_property(TARGET TargetName\n             PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 11)\n\nset_target_properties(TargetName PROPERTIES\n                      CXX_STANDARD 11)\n\nThe first form is more general, and can set multiple targets/files/tests at once, and has useful options. The second is a shortcut for setting several properties on one target. And you can get properties similarly:\nget_property(ResultVariable TARGET TargetName PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD)\n\nSee cmake-properties for a listing of all known properties. You can also make your own in some cases.2\n\n1. if statements are a bit odd in that they can take the variable with or without the surrounding syntax; this is there for historical reasons: if predates the ${} syntax. ↩\n\n\n2. Interface targets, for example, may have limits on custom properties that are allowed. ↩\n\n"},"chapters/basics/functions.html":{"url":"chapters/basics/functions.html","title":"Programming in CMake","keywords":"","body":"Programming in CMake\nControl flow\nCMake has an if statement, though over the years it has become rather complex. There are a series of all caps keywords you can use inside an if statement, and you can often refer to variables by either directly by name or using the ${} syntax (the if statement historically predates variable expansion). An example if statement:\nif(variable)\n    # If variable is `ON`, `YES`, `TRUE`, `Y`, or non zero number\nelse()\n    # If variable is `0`, `OFF`, `NO`, `FALSE`, `N`, `IGNORE`, `NOTFOUND`, `\"\"`, or ends in `-NOTFOUND`\nendif()\n# If variable does not expand to one of the above, CMake will expand it then try again\n\nSince this can be a little confusing if you explicitly put a variable expansion, like ${variable}, due to the potential expansion of an expansion, a policy (CMP0054) was added in CMake 3.1+ that keeps a quoted expansion from being expanded yet again. So, as long as the minimum version of CMake is 3.1+, you can do:\nif(\"${variable}\")\n    # True if variable is not false-like\nelse()\n    # Note that undefined variables would be `\"\"` thus false\nendif()\n\nThere are a variety of keywords as well, such as:\n\nUnary: NOT, TARGET, EXISTS (file), DEFINED, etc.\nBinary: STREQUAL, AND, OR, MATCHES (regular expression), VERSION_LESS, VERSION_LESS_EQUAL (CMake 3.7+), etc.\nParentheses can be used to group\n\ngenerator-expressions\ngenerator-expressions are really powerful, but a bit odd and specialized. Most CMake commands happen at configure time, include the if statements seen above. But what if you need logic to occur at build time or even install time? Generator expressions were added for this purpose.1 They are evaluated in target properties.\nThe simplest generator expressions are informational expressions, and are of the form $; they evaluate to a piece of information relevant for the current configuration. The other form is $, where KEYWORD is a keyword that controls the evaluation, and value is the item to evaluate (an informational expression keyword is allowed here, too). If KEYWORD is a generator expression or variable that evaluates to 0 or 1, value is substituted\nif 1 and not if 0. You can nest generator expressions, and you can use variables to make reading nested variables bearable. Some\nexpressions allow multiple values, separated by commas.2\nIf you want to put a compile flag only for the DEBUG configuration, for example, you could do:\ntarget_compile_options(MyTarget PRIVATE \"$:--my-flag>\")\nThis is a newer, better way to add things than using specialized *_DEBUG variables, and generalized to all the things generator expressions support. Note that you should never, never use the configure time value for the current configuration, because multi-configuration generators like IDEs do not have a \"current\" configuration at configure time, only at build time through generator expressions and custom *_ variables.\nOther common uses for generator expressions:\n\nLimiting an item to a certain language only, such as CXX, to avoid it mixing with something like CUDA, or wrapping it so that it is different depending on target language.\nAccessing configuration dependent properties, like target file location.\nGiving a different location for build and install directories.\n\nThat last one is very common. You'll see something like this in almost every package that supports installing:\ntarget_include_directories(\n    MyTarget\n  PUBLIC\n    $\n    $\n)\n\nMacros and Functions\nYou can define your own CMake function or macro easily. The only difference between a function and a macro is scope; macros don't have one. So, if you set a variable in a function and want it to be visible outside, you'll need PARENT_SCOPE. Nesting functions therefore is a bit tricky, since you'll have to explicitly set the variables you want visible to the outside world to PARENT_SCOPE in each function. But, functions don't \"leak\" all their variables like macros do. For the\nfollowing examples, I'll use functions.\nAn example of a simple function is as follows:\nfunction(SIMPLE REQUIRED_ARG)\n    message(STATUS \"Simple arguments: ${REQUIRED_ARG}, followed by ${ARGV}\")\n    set(${REQUIRED_ARG} \"From SIMPLE\" PARENT_SCOPE)\nendfunction()\n\nsimple(This)\nmessage(\"Output: ${This}\")\n\nIf you want positional arguments, they are listed explicitly, and all other arguments are collected in ARGN (ARGV holds all arguments, even the ones you list). You have to work around the fact that CMake does not have return values by setting variables. In the example above, you can explicitly give a variable name to set.\nArguments\nCMake has a named variable system that you've already seen in most of the build in CMake functions. You can use it with the cmake_parse_arguments function. If you want to support a version of CMake less than 3.5, you'll want to also include the CMakeParseArguments module, which is where it used to live before becoming a built in command. Here is an example of how to use it:\nfunction(COMPLEX)\n    cmake_parse_arguments(\n        COMPLEX_PREFIX\n        \"SINGLE;ANOTHER\"\n        \"ONE_VALUE;ALSO_ONE_VALUE\"\n        \"MULTI_VALUES\"\n        ${ARGN}\n    )\nendfunction()\n\ncomplex(SINGLE ONE_VALUE value MULTI_VALUES some other values)\n\nInside the function after this call, you'll find:\nCOMPLEX_PREFIX_SINGLE = TRUE\nCOMPLEX_PREFIX_ANOTHER = FALSE\nCOMPLEX_PREFIX_ONE_VALUE = \"value\"\nCOMPLEX_PREFIX_ALSO_ONE_VALUE = \nCOMPLEX_PREFIX_MULTI_VALUES = \"some;other;values\"\n\nIf you look at the official page, you'll see a slightly different method using set to avoid explicitly writing the semicolons in the list; feel free to use the structure you like best. You can mix it with the positional arguments listed above; any remaining arguments (therefore optional positional arguments) are in COMPLEX_PREFIX_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS.\n\n1. They act as if they are evaluated at build/install time, though actually they are evaluated for each build configuration. ↩\n\n\n2. The CMake docs splits expressions into Informational, Logical, and Output. ↩\n\n"},"chapters/basics/comms.html":{"url":"chapters/basics/comms.html","title":"Communicating with your code","keywords":"","body":"Communication with your code\nConfigure File\nCMake allows you to access CMake variables from your code using configure_file. This command copies a file (traditionally ending in .in from one place to another, substituting all CMake variables it finds. If you want to avoid replacing existing ${} syntax in your input file, use the @ONLY keyword. There's also a COPY_ONLY keyword if you are just using this as a replacement for file(COPY.\nThis functionality is used quite frequently; for example, on Version.h.in:\nVersion.h.in\n#pragma once\n\n#define MY_VERSION_MAJOR @PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR@\n#define MY_VERSION_MINOR @PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR@\n#define MY_VERSION_PATCH @PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH@\n#define MY_VERSION_TWEAK @PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK@\n#define MY_VERSION \"@PROJECT_VERSION@\"\n\nCMake lines:\nconfigure_file (\n    \"${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/My/Version.h.in\"\n    \"${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/include/My/Version.h\"\n)\n\nYou should include the binary include directory as well when building your project. If you want to put any true/false variables in a header, CMake has C specific #cmakedefine and #cmakedefine01 replacements to make appropriate define lines.\nYou can also (and often do) use this to produce .cmake files, such as the configure files (see installing).\nReading files\nThe other direction can be done too; you can read in something (like a version) from your source files. If you have a header only library that you'd like to make available with or without CMake, for example, then this would be the best way to handle a version. This would look something like this:\n# Assuming the canonical version is listed in a single line\n# This would be in several parts if picking up from MAJOR, MINOR, etc.\nset(VERSION_REGEX \"#define MY_VERSION[ \\t]+\\\"(.+)\\\"\")\n\n# Read in the line containing the version\nfile(STRINGS \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/My/Version.hpp\"\n    VERSION_STRING REGEX ${VERSION_REGEX})\n\n# Pick out just the version\nstring(REGEX REPLACE ${VERSION_REGEX} \"\\\\1\" VERSION_STRING \"${VERSION_STRING}\")\n\n# Automatically getting PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR, My_VERSION_MAJOR, etc.\nproject(My LANGUAGES CXX VERSION ${VERSION_STRING})\n\nAbove, file(STRINGS file_name variable_name REGEX regex) picks lines that match a regex; and the same regex is used to then pick out the parentheses capture group with the version part. Replace is used with back substitution to output only that one group.\n"},"chapters/basics/structure.html":{"url":"chapters/basics/structure.html","title":"How to Structure Your Project","keywords":"","body":"How to structure your project\nThe following information is biased. But in a good way, I think. I'm going to tell you how to structure the directories in your project. This is based on convention, but will help you:\n\nEasily read other projects following the same patters,\nAvoid a pattern that causes conflicts,\nKeep from muddling and complicating your build.\n\nFirst, this is what your files should look like when you start if your project is creatively called project, with a library called lib, and a executable called app:\n- project\n  - .gitignore\n  - README.md\n  - LICENCE.md\n  - CMakeLists.txt\n  - cmake\n    - FindSomeLib.cmake\n    - something_else.cmake\n  - include\n    - project\n      - lib.hpp\n  - src\n    - CMakeLists.txt\n    - lib.cpp\n  - apps\n    - CMakeLists.txt\n    - app.cpp\n  - tests\n    - CMakeLists.txt\n    - testlib.cpp\n  - docs\n    - CMakeLists.txt\n  - extern\n    - googletest\n  - scripts\n    - helper.py\nThe names are not absolute; you'll see contention about test/ vs. tests/, and the application folder may be called something else (or not exist for a library-only project). You'll also sometime see a python folder for python bindings, or a cmake folder for helper CMake files, like Find.cmake files. But the basics are there.\nNotice a few things already apparent; the CMakeLists.txt files are split up over all source directories, and are not in the include directories. This is because you should be able to copy the contents of the include directory to /usr/include or similar directly (except for configuration headers, which I go over in another chapter), and not have any extra files or cause any conflicts. That's also why there is a directory for your project inside the include directory. Use add_subdirectory to add a subdirectory containing a CMakeLists.txt.\nYou often want a cmake folder, with all of your helper modules. This is where your Find*.cmake files go. An set of some common helpers is at github.com/CLIUtils/cmake. To add this folder to your CMake path:\nset(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH \"${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake\" ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH})\n\nYour extern folder should contain git submodules almost exclusively. That way, you can control the version of the dependencies explicitly, but still upgrade easily. See the Testing chapter for an example of adding a submodule.\nYou should have something like /build* in your .gitignore, so that users can make build directories in the source directory and use those to build. A few packages prohibit this, but it's much better than doing a true out-of-source build and having to type something different for each package you build.\nIf you want to avoid the build directory being in a valid source directory, add this near the top of your CMakeLists:\n### Require out-of-source builds\nfile(TO_CMAKE_PATH \"${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/CMakeLists.txt\" LOC_PATH)\nif(EXISTS \"${LOC_PATH}\")\n    message(FATAL_ERROR \"You cannot build in a source directory (or any directory with a CMakeLists.txt file). Please make a build subdirectory. Feel free to remove CMakeCache.txt and CMakeFiles.\")\nendif()\n\nSee the extended code example here.\n"},"chapters/basics/programs.html":{"url":"chapters/basics/programs.html","title":"Running Other Programs","keywords":"","body":"Running other programs\nRunning a command at configure time\nRunning a command at configure time is relatively easy. Use execute_process to run a process and access the results. It is generally a good idea to avoid hard coding a program path into your CMake; you can use ${CMAKE_COMMAND}, find_package(Git), or find_program to get access to a command to run. Use RESULT_VARIABLE to check the return code and OUTPUT_VARIABLE to get the output.\nHere is an example that updates all git submodules:\nfind_package(Git QUIET)\n\nif(GIT_FOUND AND EXISTS \"${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/.git\")\n    execute_process(COMMAND ${GIT_EXECUTABLE} submodule update --init --recursive\n                    WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}\n                    RESULT_VARIABLE GIT_SUBMOD_RESULT)\n    if(NOT GIT_SUBMOD_RESULT EQUAL \"0\")\n        message(FATAL_ERROR \"git submodule update --init failed with ${GIT_SUBMOD_RESULT}, please checkout submodules\")\n    endif()\nendif()\n\nRunning a command at build time\nBuild time commands are a bit trickier. The main complication comes from the target system; when do you want your command to run? Does it produce an output that another target needs? With this in mind, here is an example that calls a Python script to generate a header file:\nfind_package(PythonInterp REQUIRED)\nadd_custom_command(OUTPUT \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/include/Generated.hpp\"\n    COMMAND \"${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE}\" \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/scripts/GenerateHeader.py\" --argument\n    DEPENDS some_target)\n\nadd_custom_target(generate_header ALL\n    DEPENDS \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/include/Generated.hpp\")\n\ninstall(FILES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/include/Generated.hpp DESTINATION include)\n\nHere, the generation happens after some_target is complete, and happens when you run make without a target (ALL). If you make this a dependency of another target with add_dependencies, you could avoid the ALL keyword. Or, you could require that a user explicitly builds the generate_header target when making.\nIncluded common utilities\nA useful tool in writing CMake builds that work cross-platform is cmake -E  (seen in CMake files as ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E). This mode allows CMake to do a variety of things without calling system tools explicitly, like copy, make_directory, and remove. It is mostly used for the build time commands. Note that the very useful create_symlink mode used to be Unix only, but was added for Windows in CMake 3.13.

Really. Just not in CMake 2.8, because, guess what, C++11 didn't exist in 2009 when 2.0 was released. As long as you are using CMake 3.1 or newer, you should be fine, there are two different ways to enable support. And as you'll soon see, there's even better support in CMake 3.8+. I'll start with that, since this is Modern CMake.\nCMake 3.8+: Meta compiler features\nAs long as you can require that a user install CMake, you'll have access to the newest way to enable C++ standards. This is the most powerful way, with the nicest syntax and the best support for new standards, and the best target behavior for mixing standards and options. Assuming you have a target named myTarget, it looks like this:\ntarget_compile_features(myTarget PUBLIC cxx_std_11)\nset_target_properties(myTarget PROPERTIES CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)\n\nFor the first line, we get to pick between cxx_std_11,  cxx_std_14, and cxx_std_17. The second line is optional, but will avoid extensions being added; without it you'd get things like  -std=g++11 replacing -std=c++11. The first line even works on INTERFACE targets; only actual compiled targets can use the second line.\nIf a target further down the dependency chain specifies a higher C++ level, this interacts nicely. It's really just a more advanced version of the following method, so it interacts nicely with that, too.\nCMake 3.1+: Compiler features\nYou can ask for specific compiler features to be available. This was more granular than asking for a C++ version, though it's a bit tricky to pick out just the features a package is using unless you wrote the package and have a good memory. Since this ultimately checks against a list of options CMake knows your compiler supports and picks the highest flag indicated in that list, you don't have to specify all the options you need, just the rarest ones. The syntax is identical to the section above, you just have a list of options to pick instead of cxx_std_* options. See the whole list here.\nIf you have optional features, you can use the list CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES and use if(... IN_LIST ...) from CMake 3.3+ to see if that feature is supported, and add it conditionally. See the docs here for other use cases.\nA related feature, WriteCompilerDetectionHeader, is worth checking out. It is a module that lets you make a file with macros allowing you to check and support optional features for specific compilers. Like any header generator, this will require that you build with CMake so that your header can be generated as part of the build process (only important if you care about supporting multiple build systems, or if you are making a no-build header-only library).\nCMake 3.1+: Global and property settings\nThere is another way that C++ standards are supported; a specific set of three properties (both global and target level). The global properties are:\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)\nset(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)\n\nThe first line sets a C++ standard level, and the second tells CMake to use it, and the final line is optional and ensures -std=c++11 vs. something like -std=g++11. This method isn't bad for a final package, but shouldn't be used by a library. You can also set these values on a target:\nset_target_properties(myTarget PROPERTIES\n    CXX_STANDARD 11\n    CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED YES\n    CXX_EXTENSIONS NO\n)\n\nWhich is better, but still doesn't have the sort of explicit control that compiler features have for populating PRIVATE and INTERFACE properties.\nYou can find more information about the final two methods on Craig Scott's useful blog post.\nDon't set manual flags yourself. You'll then become responsible for mainting correct flags for every release of every compiler, error messages for unsupported compilers won't be useful, and some IDEs might not pick up the manual flags.\n\n"},"chapters/features/small.html":{"url":"chapters/features/small.html","title":"Small but common needs","keywords":"","body":"Adding Features\nThere are lots of compiler and linker settings. When you need to add something special, you could check first to see if CMake supports it; if it does, you can avoid explicitly tying yourself to a compiler version. And, better yet, you explain what you mean in your CMakeLists, rather than spewing flags.\nThe first and most common feature was C++ standards support, which got it's own chapter.\nPosition independent code\nThis is best known as the -fPIC flag. Much of the time, you don't need to do anything. CMake will include the flag for SHARED or MODULE libraries. If you do explicitly need it:\nset(CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)\n\nwill do it globally, or:\nset_target_properties(lib1 PROPERTIES POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)\n\nto explicitly turn it ON (or OFF) for a target.\nLittle libraries\nIf you need to link to the dl library, with -ldl on Linux, just use the built-in CMake variable ${CMAKE_DL_LIBS} in a target_link_libraries command. No module or find_package needed. (This adds whatever is needed to get dlopen and dlclose)\nUnfortunately, the math library is not so lucky. If you need to explicitly link to it, you can always do target_link_libraries(MyTarget PUBLIC m), but it might be better to use CMake's generic find_library:\nfind_library(MATH_LIBRARY m)\nif(MATH_LIBRARY)\n    target_link_libraries(MyTarget PUBLIC ${MATH_LIBRARY})\nendif()\n\nYou can pretty easily find Find*.cmake's for this and other libraries that you need with a quick search; most major packages have a helper library of CMake modules. See the chapter on existing package inclusion for more.\nInterprocedural optimization\nINTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION, best known as link time optimization and the -flto flag, is available on very recent versions of CMake. You can turn this on with CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION (CMake 3.9+ only) or the INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION property on targets. Support for GCC and Clang was added in CMake 3.8. If you set cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9) or better (see CMP0069), setting this to ON on a target is an error if the compiler doesn't support it. You can use check_ipo_supported(), from the built-in CheckIPOSupported module, to see if support is available before hand. An example of 3.9 style usage:\ninclude(CheckIPOSupported)\ncheck_ipo_supported(RESULT result)\nif(result)\n  set_target_properties(foo PROPERTIES INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)\nendif()\n\n"},"chapters/features/utilities.html":{"url":"chapters/features/utilities.html","title":"Utilities","keywords":"","body":"CCache and Utilities\nOver the versions, common utilities that help you write good code have had support added to CMake. This is usually in the form of a property and matching CMAKE_* initialization variable. The feature is not meant to be tied to one special program, but rather any program that is somewhat similar in behavior.\nAll of these take ; separated values (a standard list in CMake) that describe the program and options that you should run on the source files of this target.\nCCache\nSet the CMAKE__COMPILER_LAUNCHER variable or the _COMPILER_LAUNCHER property on a target to use something like CCache to \"wrap\" the compilation of the target. Support for CCache has been expanding in the latest versions of CMake. In practice, this tends to look like this:\nfind_program(CCACHE_PROGRAM ccache)\nif(CCACHE_PROGRAM)\n    set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER \"${CCACHE_PROGRAM}\")\n    set(CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER_LAUNCHER \"${CCACHE_PROGRAM}\") # CMake 3.9+\nendif()\n\nUtilities\nSet the following properties or CMAKE_* initializer variables to the command line for the tools. Most of them are limited to C or CXX with make or ninja generators.\n\n_CLANG_TIDY: CMake 3.6+\n_CPPCHECK\n_CPPLINT\n_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE\n\nClang tidy\nThis is the command line for running clang-tidy, as a list (remember, a semicolon separated string is a list).\nHere is a simple example of using Clang-Tidy:\ncmake -S . -B build-tidy -DCMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY=\"$(which clang-tidy);-fix\"\ncmake --build build -j 1\n\nThe -fix part is optional, and will modify your source files to try to fix\nthe tidy warning issued. If you are working in a git repository, this is fairly\nsafe as you can see what has changed. However, make sure you do not run your\nmakefile/ninja build in parallel! This will not work very well at all if it\ntries to fix the same header twice.\nIf you want to explicitly use the target form to ensure you only call this on\nyour local targets, you can set a variable (maybe something like\nDO_CLANG_TIDY) instead of the CMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY variable, then add it to\nyour target properties as you create them. You can find clang-tidy in your path\nlike this:\nfind_program(\n    CLANG_TIDY_EXE\n    NAMES \"clang-tidy\"\n    DOC \"Path to clang-tidy executable\"\n)\n\nInclude what you use\nThis is an example for using include what you use. First, you'll need to have\nthe tool, such as in a docker container or with brew (macOS) with brew install\ninclude-what-you-use.  Then, you can pass this into your build without\nmodifying the source:\nbuild # cmake -S . -B build-iwyu -DCMAKE_CXX_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE=include-what-you-use\n\nFinally, you can collect the output and (optionally) apply the fixes:\nbuild # cmake --build build-iwyu 2> iwyu.out\nbuild # fix_includes.py \n(You should check the fixes first, or touch them up after applying!)\nLink what you use\nThere is a boolean target property, LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE, that will check for extraneous files when linking.\nClang-format\nClang-format doesn't really have an integration with CMake, unfortunately. You could make a custom target (See this post, or you can run it manually. An interesting project that I have not really tried is here; it adds a format target and even makes sure that you can't commit unformatted files.\nThe following two line would do that in a git repository in bash (assuming you have a .clang-format file):\ngitbook $ git ls-files -- '*.cpp' '*.h' | xargs clang-format -i -style=file\ngitbook $ git diff --exit-code --color\n\n"},"chapters/features/modules.html":{"url":"chapters/features/modules.html","title":"Useful modules","keywords":"","body":"Useful Modules\nThere are a ton of useful modules in CMake's modules collection; but some of them are more useful than others. Here are a few highlights.\nCMakeDependentOption\nThis adds a command cmake_dependent_option that sets an option based on another set of variables being true. It looks like this:\ninclude(CMakeDependentOption)\ncmake_dependent_option(BUILD_TESTS \"Build your tests\" ON \"VAL1;VAL2\" OFF)\n\nwhich is just a shortcut for this:\nif(VAL1 AND VAL2)\n    set(BUILD_TESTS_DEFAULT ON)\nelse()\n    set(BUILD_TESTS_DEFAULT OFF)\nendif()\n\noption(BUILD_TESTS \"Build your tests\" ${BUILD_TESTS_DEFAULT})\n\nif(NOT BUILD_TESTS_DEFAULT)\n    mark_as_advanced(BUILD_TESTS)\nendif()\n\nNote that BUILD_TESTING is a better way to check for testing being enabled if you use include(CTest), since it is defined for you. This is just an example of CMakeDependentOption.\nCMakePrintHelpers\nThis module has a couple of handy output functions. cmake_print_properties lets you easily print properties.\nAnd cmake_print_variables will print the names and values of any variables you give it.\nCheckCXXCompilerFlag\nThis checks to see if a flag is supported. For example:\ninclude(CheckCXXCompilerFlag)\ncheck_cxx_compiler_flag(-someflag OUTPUT_VARIABLE)\n\nNote that OUTPUT_VARIABLE will also appear in the configuration printout, so choose a good name.\nThis is just one of many similar modules, such as CheckIncludeFileCXX, CheckStructHasMember, TestBigEndian, and CheckTypeSize that allow you\nto check for information about the system (and you can communicate that to your source code).\nWriteCompilerDetectionHeader\nThis is an amazing module similar to the ones listed above, but special enough to deserve its own section. It allows you\nto look for a list of features that some compilers support, and write out a C++ header file that lets you know whether that\nfeature is available. It even can provide compatibility macros for features that have changed names!\nTo use:\nwrite_compiler_detection_header(\n  FILE myoutput.h\n  PREFIX My\n  COMPILERS GNU Clang MSVC Intel\n  FEATURES cxx_variadic_templates\n)\n\nThis supports compiler features (defined to 0 or 1), symbols (defined to empty or the symbol), and macros that\nsupport different names. They will be prefixed with the PREFIX you provide. You can separate compilers into different\nfiles using OUTPUT_FILES_DIR.\nThe downside is that you do have to list the compilers you expect to support. If you use the ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILERS flag(s),\nyou can keep this from erroring on unknown compilers, but it will still leave all features empty.\ntry_compile/try_run\nThis is not exactly a module, but is crucial to many of the modules listed above. You can attempt to compile (and possibly run) a bit of code at configure time. This can allow you to get information about the capabilities of your system. The basic syntax is:\ntry_compile(\n  RESULT_VAR\n    bindir\n  SOURCES\n    source.cpp\n)\n\nThere are lots of options you can add, like COMPILE_DEFINITIONS. In CMake 3.8+, this will honor the CMake C/C++/CUDA standard settings. If you use try_run instead, it will run the resulting program and give you the output in RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE.\nFeatureSummary\nThis is a fairly useful but rather odd module. It allows you to print out a list of packages what were searched for, as well as any options you explicity mark. It's partially but not completely tied into find_package. You first include the module, as always:\ninclude(FeatureSummary)\n\nThen, for any find packages you have run or will run, you can extend the default information:\nset_package_properties(OpenMP PROPERTIES\n    URL \"http://www.openmp.org\"\n    DESCRIPTION \"Parallel compiler directives\"\n    PURPOSE \"This is what it does in my package\")\n\nYou can also set the TYPE of a package to RUNTIME, OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED, or REQUIRED; you can't, however, lower the type of a package; if you have already added a REQUIRED package through find_package based on an option, you'll see it listed as REQUIRED.\nAnd, you can mark any options as part of the feature summary. If you choose the same name as a package, the two interact with each other.\nadd_feature_info(WITH_OPENMP OpenMP_CXX_FOUND \"OpenMP (Thread safe FCNs only)\")\n\nThen, you can print out the summary of features, either to the screen or a log file:\nif(CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME STREQUAL PROJECT_NAME)\n    feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES DISABLED_FEATURES PACKAGES_FOUND)\n    feature_summary(FILENAME ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/features.log WHAT ALL)\nendif()\n\nYou can build any collection of WHAT items that you like, or just use ALL.\n"},"chapters/features/ides.html":{"url":"chapters/features/ides.html","title":"IDEs","keywords":"","body":"Supporting IDEs\nIn general, IDEs are already supported by a standard CMake project. There are just a few extra things that can help IDEs perform even better.\nFolders for targets\nSome IDEs, like Xcode, support folders. You have to manually enable the USE_FOLDERS global property to allow CMake to organize your files by folders:\nset_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY USE_FOLDERS ON)\n\nThen, you can add targets to folders after you create them:\nset_property(TARGET MyFile PROPERTY FOLDER \"Scripts\")\n\nFolders can be nested with /.\nYou can control how files show up in each folder with regular expressions or explicit listings in source_group:\nFolders for files\nYou can also control how the folders inside targets appear. There are two ways, both using the source_group command. The traditional way is\nsource_group(\"Source Files\\\\New Directory\" REGULAR_EXPRESSION \".*\\\\.c[ucp]p?\")\n\nYou can explicitly list files with FILES, or use a REGULAR_EXPRESSION. This way you have complete control over the folder structure. However, if your on-disk layout is well designed, you might just want to mimic that. In CMake 3.8+, you can do so very easily with a new version of the source_group command:\nsource_group(TREE \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/base/dir\" PREFIX \"Header Files\" FILES ${FILE_LIST})\n\nFor the TREE option, you should usually give a full path starting with something like ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/ (because the command interprets paths relative to the build directory).\nThe prefix tells you where it puts it into the IDE structure, and the FILES option takes a list of files.\nCMake will strip the TREE path from the FILE_LIST path, it will add PREFIX, and that will be the IDE folder structure.\n\nNote: If you need to support CMake this blog post.\n\nRunning with an IDE\nTo use an IDE, either pass -G\"name of IDE\" if CMake can produce that IDE's files (like Xcode, Visual Studio), or open the CMakeLists.txt file from your IDE if that IDE has built in support for CMake (CLion, QtCreator, many others).\n"},"chapters/features/debug.html":{"url":"chapters/features/debug.html","title":"Debugging","keywords":"","body":"Debugging code\nYou might need to debug your CMake build, or debug your C++ code. Both are covered here.\nCMake debugging\nFirst, let's look at ways to debug a CMakeLists or other CMake file.\nPrinting variables\nThe time honored method of print statements looks like this in CMake:\nmessage(STATUS \"MY_VARIABLE=${MY_VARIABLE}\")\n\nHowever, a built in module makes this even easier:\ninclude(CMakePrintHelpers)\ncmake_print_variables(MY_VARIABLE)\n\nIf you want to print out a property, this is much, much nicer! Instead of getting the properties one by one of of each target (or other item with properties, such as SOURCES, DIRECTORIES, TESTS, or CACHE_ENTRIES - global properties seem to be missing for some reason), you can simply list them and get them printed directly:\ncmake_print_properties(\n    TARGETS my_target\n    PROPERTIES POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\n)\n\nTracing a run\nHave you wanted to watch exactly what happens in your CMake file, and when? The --trace-source=\"filename\" feature is fantastic. Every line run in the file that you give will be echoed to the screen when it is run, letting you follow exactly what is happening. There are related options as well, but they tend to bury you in output.\nFor example:\ncmake -S . -B build --trace-source=CMakeLists.txt\n\nIf you add --trace-expand, the variables will be expanded into their values.\nBuilding in debug mode\nFor single-configuration generators, you can build your code with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to get debugging flags. In multi-configuration generators, like many IDEs, you can pick the configuration in the IDE. There are distinct flags for this mode (variables ending in _DEBUG as opposed to _RELEASE), as well as a generator expression value CONFIG:Debug or CONFIG:Release.\nOnce you make a debug build, you can run a debugger, such as gdb or lldb on it.\n"},"chapters/projects.html":{"url":"chapters/projects.html","title":"Including Projects","keywords":"","body":"Including Small Projects\nThis is where a good Git system plus CMake shines.

This works very well in most ways. When you are inside the submodule, you can treat it just like a normal repo, and when you are in the parent repository, you can \"add\" to change the current commit pointer.\nBut the traditional downside is that you either have to have your users know git submodule commands, so they can init and update the repo, or they have to add --recursive when they initially clone your repo. CMake can offer a solution:\nfind_package(Git QUIET)\nif(GIT_FOUND AND EXISTS \"${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/.git\")\n# Update submodules as needed\n    option(GIT_SUBMODULE \"Check submodules during build\" ON)\n    if(GIT_SUBMODULE)\n        message(STATUS \"Submodule update\")\n        execute_process(COMMAND ${GIT_EXECUTABLE} submodule update --init --recursive\n                        WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}\n                        RESULT_VARIABLE GIT_SUBMOD_RESULT)\n        if(NOT GIT_SUBMOD_RESULT EQUAL \"0\")\n            message(FATAL_ERROR \"git submodule update --init failed with ${GIT_SUBMOD_RESULT}, please checkout submodules\")\n        endif()\n    endif()\nendif()\n\nif(NOT EXISTS \"${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/extern/repo/CMakeLists.txt\")\n    message(FATAL_ERROR \"The submodules were not downloaded!

Then, if you are in a git checkout of your source, add an option (defaulting to ON) that allows developers to turn off the feature if they need to. We then run the command to get all repositories, and fail if that command fails, with a nice error message. Finally, we verify that the repositories exist before continuing, regardless of the method used to obtain them. You can use OR to list several.\nNow, your users can be completely oblivious to the existence of the submodules, and you can still keep up good development practices! The only thing to watch out for is for developers; you will reset the submodule when you rerun CMake if you are developing inside the submodule. Just add new commits to the parent staging area, and you'll be fine.\nYou can then include projects that provide good CMake support:\nadd_subdirectory(extern/repo)\n\nOr, you can build an interface library target yourself if it is a header only project. Or, you can use find_package if that is supported, probably preparing the initial search directory to be the one you've added (check the docs or the file for the Find*.cmake file you are using).

The key ideas are:\n\nUse FetchContent_Declare(MyName) to get data or a package. You can set URLs, Git repositories, and more.\nUse FetchContent_GetProperties(MyName) on the name you picked in the first step to get MyName_* variables.\nCheck MyName_POPULATED, and if not populated, use FetchContent_Populate(MyName) (and if a package, add_subdirectory(\"${MyName_SOURCE_DIR}\" \"${MyName_BINARY_DIR}\"))\n\nFor example, to download Catch2:\nFetchContent_Declare(\n  catch\n  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git\n  GIT_TAG        v2.13.0\n)\n\n# CMake 3.14+\nFetchContent_MakeAvailable(catch)\n\nIf you can't use CMake 3.14+, the classic way to prepare code was:\n# CMake 3.11+\nFetchContent_GetProperties(catch)\nif(NOT catch_POPULATED)\n  FetchContent_Populate(catch)\n  add_subdirectory(${catch_SOURCE_DIR} ${catch_BINARY_DIR})\nendif()\n\nOf course, you could bundled this up into a macro:\nif(${CMAKE_VERSION} VERSION_LESS 3.14)\n    macro(FetchContent_MakeAvailable NAME)\n        FetchContent_GetProperties(${NAME})\n        if(NOT ${NAME}_POPULATED)\n            FetchContent_Populate(${NAME})\n            add_subdirectory(${${NAME}_SOURCE_DIR} ${${NAME}_BINARY_DIR})\n        endif()\n    endmacro()\nendif()\n\nNow you have the CMake 3.14+ syntax in CMake 3.11+.\nSee the example here.\n"},"chapters/testing.html":{"url":"chapters/testing.html","title":"Testing","keywords":"","body":"Testing\nGeneral Testing Information\nIn your main CMakeLists.txt you need to add the following function call (not in a subfolder):\nif(CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME STREQUAL PROJECT_NAME)\n    include(CTest)\nendif()\n\nWhich will enable testing and set a BUILD_TESTING option so users can turn testing on and off (along with a few other things).

Downloading a copy for each project is the recommended way to use GoogleTest (so much so, in fact, that they have disabled the automatic CMake install target), so this respects that design decision. This method downloads the project at configure time, so that IDEs correctly find the libraries.

These were designed for libraries whose authors did not support CMake. Use a Config.cmake instead as listed below.\nAdd Subproject\nA package can include your project in a subdirectory, and then use add_subdirectory on the subdirectory. This useful for header-only and quick-to-compile libraries. Note that the install commands may interfere with the parent project, so you can add EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL to the add_subdirectory command; the targets you explicitly use will still be built.\nIn order to support this as a library author, make sure you use CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR instead of PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR (and likewise for other variables, like binary dirs). You can check CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME STREQUAL PROJECT_NAME to only add options or defaults that make sense if this is a project.\nAlso, since namespaces are a good idea, and the usage of your library should be consistent with the other methods below, you should add\nadd_library(MyLib::MyLib ALIAS MyLib)\n\nto standardise the usage across all methods. This ALIAS target will not be exported below.\nExporting\nThe third way is *Config.cmake scripts; that will be the topic of the next chapter in this session.\n"},"chapters/install/installing.html":{"url":"chapters/install/installing.html","title":"Installing","keywords":"","body":"Installing\nInstall commands cause a file or target to be \"installed\" into the install tree when you make install. Your basic target install command looks like this:\ninstall(TARGETS MyLib\n        EXPORT MyLibTargets\n        LIBRARY DESTINATION lib\n        ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib\n        RUNTIME DESTINATION bin\n        INCLUDES DESTINATION include\n        )\n\nThe various destinations are only needed if you have a library, static library, or program to install. The includes destination is special; since a target does not install includes. It only sets the includes destination on the exported target (which is often already set by target_include_directories, so check the MyLibTargets file and make sure you don't have the include directory included twice if you want clean cmake files).\nIt's usually a good idea to give CMake access to the version, so that find_package can have a version specified. That looks like this:\ninclude(CMakePackageConfigHelpers)\nwrite_basic_package_version_file(\n    MyLibConfigVersion.cmake\n    VERSION ${PACKAGE_VERSION}\n    COMPATIBILITY AnyNewerVersion\n    )\n\nYou have two choices next. You need to make a MyLibConfig.cmake, but you can do it either by exporting your targets directly to it, or by writing it by hand, then including the targets file. The later option is what you'll need if you have any dependencies, even just OpenMP, so I'll illustrate that method.\nFirst, make an install targets file (very similar to the one you made in the build directory):\ninstall(EXPORT MyLibTargets\n        FILE MyLibTargets.cmake\n        NAMESPACE MyLib::\n        DESTINATION lib/cmake/MyLib\n         )\n\nThis file will take the targets you exported and put them in a file. If you have no dependencies, just use MyLibConfig.cmake instead of MyLibTargets.cmake here. Then write a custom MyLibConfig.cmake file in your source tree somewhere. If you want to capture configure time variables, you can use a .in file, and you will want to use the @var@ syntax. The contents that look like this:\ninclude(CMakeFindDependencyMacro)\n\n# Capturing values from configure (optional)\nset(my-config-var @my-config-var@)\n\n# Same syntax as find_package\nfind_dependency(MYDEP REQUIRED)\n\n# Any extra setup\n\n# Add the targets file\ninclude(\"${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/MyLibTargets.cmake\")\n\nNow, you can use configure file (if you used a .in file) and then install the resulting file.\nSince we've made a ConfigVersion file, this is a good place to install it too.\nconfigure_file(MyLibConfig.cmake.in MyLibConfig.cmake @ONLY)\ninstall(FILES \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/MyLibConfig.cmake\"\n              \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/MyLibConfigVersion.cmake\"\n        DESTINATION lib/cmake/MyLib\n        )\n\nThat's it! Now once you install a package, there will be files in lib/cmake/MyLib that CMake will search for (specifically, MyLibConfig.cmake and MyLibConfigVersion.cmake), and the targets file that config uses should be there as well.\nWhen CMake searches for a package, it will look in the current install prefix and several standard places. You can also add this to your search path manually, including MyLib_PATH, and CMake gives the user nice help output if the configure file is not found.\n"},"chapters/install/exporting.html":{"url":"chapters/install/exporting.html","title":"Exporting","keywords":"","body":"Exporting\nThe default behavior for exporting changed in CMake 3.15. Since changing files in a user's home directory is considered \"surprising\" (and it is, which is why this chapter exists), it is no longer the default behavior. If you set a minimum or maximum CMake version of 3.15 or later, this will no longer happen unless you set CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY as shown below.\n\nThere are three ways to access a project from another project: subdirectory, exported build directories, and installing. To use the build directory of one project in another project, you will need to export targets. Exporting targets is needed for a proper install; allowing the build directory to be used is just two added lines. It is not generally a way to work that I would recommend, but can be useful for development and as way to prepare the installation procedure discussed later.\nYou should make an export set, probably near the end of your main CMakeLists.txt:\nexport(TARGETS MyLib1 MyLib2 NAMESPACE MyLib:: FILE MyLibTargets.cmake)\n\nThis puts the targets you have listed into a file in the build directory, and optionally prefixes them with a namespace. Now, to allow CMake to find this package, export the package into the $HOME/.cmake/packages folder:\nset(CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY ON)\nexport(PACKAGE MyLib)\n\nNow, if you find_package(MyLib), CMake can find the build folder. Look at the generated MyLibTargets.cmake file to help you understand exactly what is created; it's just a normal CMake file, with the exported targets.\nNote that there's a downside: if you have imported dependencies, they will need to be imported before you find_package. That will be fixed in the next method.\n"},"chapters/install/packaging.html":{"url":"chapters/install/packaging.html","title":"Packaging","keywords":"","body":"Packaging\nThere are two ways to instruct CMake to build your package; one is to use a CPackConfig.cmake file, and the other is to integrate the CPack variables into your CMakeLists.txt file. Since you want variables from your main build to be included, like version number, you'll want to make a configure file if you go that route. I'll show you the integrated version:\n# Packaging support\nset(CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR \"Vendor name\")\nset(CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY \"Some summary\")\nset(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR ${PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR})\nset(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR ${PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR})\nset(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH ${PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH})\nset(CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/LICENCE\")\nset(CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README \"${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/README.md\")\n\nThese are the most common variables you'll need to make a binary package. A binary package uses the install mechanism of CMake, so anything that is installed will be present.\nYou can also make a source package. You should set CMAKE_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES to regular expressions that ensure you don't pick up any extra files (like the build directory or git details); otherwise make package_source will bundle up literally everything in the source directory. You can also set the source generator to make your favorite types of files for source packages:\nset(CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR \"TGZ;ZIP\")\nset(CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES\n    /.git\n    /dist\n    /.*build.*\n    /\\\\\\\\.DS_Store\n)\n\nNote that this will not work on Windows, but the generated source packages work on Windows.\nFinally, you need to include the CPack module:\ninclude(CPack)\n\n"},"chapters/packages.html":{"url":"chapters/packages.html","title":"Looking for Libraries (Packages)","keywords":"","body":"Finding Packages\nThere are two ways to find packages in CMake: \"Module\" mode and \"Config\" mode.\n"},"chapters/packages/CUDA.html":{"url":"chapters/packages/CUDA.html","title":"CUDA","keywords":"","body":"CUDA\nCUDA support is available in two flavors. The new method, introduced in CMake 3.8 (3.9 for Windows), should be strongly preferred over the old, hacky method - I only mention the old method due to the high chances of an old package somewhere having it. Unlike the older languages, CUDA support has been rapidly evolving, and building CUDA is hard, so I would recommend you require a very recent version of CMake! CMake 3.17 and 3.18 have a lot of improvements directly targeting CUDA.\nA good resource for CUDA and Modern CMake is this talk by CMake developer Robert Maynard at GTC 2017.\nAdding the CUDA Language\nThere are two ways to enable CUDA support. If CUDA is not optional:\nproject(MY_PROJECT LANGUAGES CUDA CXX)\n\nYou'll probably want CXX listed here also. And, if CUDA is optional, you'll\nwant to put this in somewhere conditionally:\nenable_language(CUDA)\n\nTo check to see if CUDA is available, use CheckLanuage:\ninclude(CheckLanguage)\ncheck_language(CUDA)\n\nYou can see if CUDA is present by checking CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER (was missing\nuntil CMake 3.11).\nYou can check variables like CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER_ID (for nvcc, this is\n\"NVIDIA\", Clang was added in CMake 3.18).  You can check the version with\nCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER_VERSION.\nVariables for CUDA\nMany variables with CXX in the name have a CUDA version with CUDA instead.\nFor example, to set the C++ standard required for CUDA,\nif(NOT DEFINED CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD)\n    set(CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD 11)\n    set(CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)\nendif()\nIf you are looking for CUDA's standard level, in CMake 3.17 a new collection of\ncompiler features were added, like cuda_std_11. These have the same benefits that\nyou are already used to from the cxx versions.\nAdding a library / executable\nThis is the easy part; as long as you use .cu for CUDA files, you can just add libraries exactly like you normally would.\nYou can also use separable compilation:\nset_target_properties(mylib PROPERTIES\n                            CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION ON)\n\nYou can also directly make a PTX file with the CUDA_PTX_COMPILATION property.\nTargeting architectures\nWhen you build CUDA code, you generally should be targeting an architecture. If you don't, you compile 'ptx', which provide the basic instructions but is compiled at runtime, making it potentially much slower to load.\nAll cards have an architecture level, like \"7.2\". You have two choices; the first is the code level; this will report to the code being compiled a version, like \"5.0\", and it will take advantage of all the features up to 5.0 but not past (assuming well written code / standard libraries). Then there's a target architecture, which must be equal or greater to the code architecture. This needs to have the same major number as your target card, and be equal to or less than the target card. So 7.0 would be a common choice for our 7.2 card. Finally, you can also generate PTX; this will work on all future cards, but will compile just in time.\nIn CMake 3.18, it became very easy to target architectures. If you have a version range that includes 3.18 or newer, you will be using CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES variable and the CUDA_ARCHITECTURES property on targets. You can list values (without the .), like 50 for arch 5.0. If set to OFF, it will not pass architectures.\nWorking with targets\nUsing targets should work similarly to CXX, but there's a problem. If you include a target that includes compiler options (flags), most of the time, the options will not be protected by the correct includes (and the chances of them having the correct CUDA wrapper is even smaller). Here's what a correct compiler options line should look like:\n\"$>:-fopenmp>$>:-Xcompiler=-fopenmp>\"\n\nHowever, if you using almost any find_package, and using the Modern CMake methods of targets and inheritance, everything will break. I've learned that the hard way.\nFor now, here's a pretty reasonable solution, as long as you know the un-aliased target name. It's a function that will fix a C++ only target by wrapping the flags if using a CUDA compiler:\nfunction(CUDA_CONVERT_FLAGS EXISTING_TARGET)\n    get_property(old_flags TARGET ${EXISTING_TARGET} PROPERTY INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS)\n    if(NOT \"${old_flags}\" STREQUAL \"\")\n        string(REPLACE \";\" \",\" CUDA_flags \"${old_flags}\")\n        set_property(TARGET ${EXISTING_TARGET} PROPERTY INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS\n            \"$>:${old_flags}>$>:-Xcompiler=${CUDA_flags}>\"\n            )\n    endif()\nendfunction()\n\nUseful variables\n\nCMAKE_CUDA_TOOLKIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES: Place for built-in Thrust, etc\nCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER: NVCC with location\n\nYou can use\nFindCUDAToolkit\nto find a variety of useful targets and variables even without enabling the\nCUDA language.\n\nNote that FindCUDA is deprecated, but for for versions of CMake \n\nCUDA version checks / picking a version\nArchitecture detection (Note: 3.12 fixes this partially)\nLinking to CUDA libraries from non-.cu files\n\n\nClassic FindCUDA [WARNING: DO NOT USE] (for reference only)\nIf you want to support an older version of CMake, I recommend at least including the FindCUDA from CMake version 3.9 in your cmake folder (see the CLIUtils github organization for a git repository). You'll want two features that were added: CUDA_LINK_LIBRARIES_KEYWORD and cuda_select_nvcc_arch_flags, along with the newer architectures and CUDA versions.\nTo use the old CUDA support, you use find_package:\nfind_package(CUDA 7.0 REQUIRED)\nmessage(STATUS \"Found CUDA ${CUDA_VERSION_STRING} at ${CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR}\")\n\nYou can control the CUDA flags with CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS (list append) and you can control separable compilation with CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION. You'll also want to make sure CUDA plays nice and adds keywords to the targets (CMake 3.9+):\nset(CUDA_LINK_LIBRARIES_KEYWORD PUBLIC)\n\nYou'll also might want to allow a user to check for the arch flags of their current hardware:\ncuda_select_nvcc_arch_flags(ARCH_FLAGS) # optional argument for arch to add\n\n"},"chapters/packages/OpenMP.html":{"url":"chapters/packages/OpenMP.html","title":"OpenMP","keywords":"","body":"OpenMP\nOpenMP support was drastically improved in CMake 3.9+.

See FindBoost for a full description; this will just give a quick overview and provide a recipe. Be sure to check the page for the minimum required version of CMake you are using and see what options you have.\nFirst, you can customize the behavior of the Boost libraries selected using a set of variables that you set before searching for Boost. There are a growing number of settings, but here are the three most common ones:\nset(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS OFF)\nset(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED ON)\nset(Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME OFF)\n\nIn CMake 3.5, imported targets were added. These targets handle dependencies for you as well, so they are a very nice way to add Boost libraries. However, CMake has the dependency information baked into it for all known versions of Boost, so CMake must be newer than Boost for these to work. In a recent merge request, CMake started assuming that the dependencies hold from the last version it knows about, and will use that (along with giving a warning). This\nfunctionality was backported into CMake 3.9.\nThe import targets are in the Boost:: namespace. Boost::boost is the header only part. The other compiled libraries are available, and include dependencies as needed.\nHere is an example for using the Boost::filesystem library:\nset(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS OFF)\nset(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED ON)\nset(Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME OFF)\nfind_package(Boost 1.50 REQUIRED COMPONENTS filesystem)\nmessage(STATUS \"Boost version: ${Boost_VERSION}\")\n\n# This is needed if your Boost version is newer than your CMake version\n# or if you have an old version of CMake (\n"},"chapters/packages/MPI.html":{"url":"chapters/packages/MPI.html","title":"MPI","keywords":"","body":"MPI\nTo add MPI, like OpenMP, you'll be best off with CMake 3.9+.\nfind_package(MPI REQUIRED)\nmessage(STATUS \"Run: ${MPIEXEC} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} ${MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS} ${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} EXECUTABLE ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS} ARGS\")\ntarget_link_libraries(MyTarget PUBLIC MPI::MPI_CXX)\n\nHowever, you can imitate this on CMake 3.1+ with:\nfind_package(MPI REQUIRED)\n\n# For supporting CMake \n"},"chapters/packages/ROOT.html":{"url":"chapters/packages/ROOT.html","title":"ROOT","keywords":"","body":"ROOT\nROOT is a C++ Toolkit for High Energy Physics. It is huge. There are really a lot of ways to use it in CMake, though many/most of the examples you'll find are probably wrong. Here's my recommendation.\nMost importantly, there are lots of improvements in CMake support in more recent versions of ROOT - Using 6.16+ is much, much easier! If you really must support 6.14 or earlier, see the section at the end. There were further improvements in 6.20, as well, it behaves much more like a proper CMake project, and exports C++ standard features for targets, etc.\nFinding ROOT\nROOT 6.10+ supports config file discovery, so you can just do:\nfind_package(ROOT 6.16 CONFIG REQUIRED)\n\nto attempt to find ROOT. If you don't have your paths set up, you can pass -DROOT_DIR=$ROOTSYS/cmake to find ROOT. (But, really, you should source thisroot.sh).\nThe right way (Targets)\nROOT 6.12 and earlier do not add the include directory for imported targets. ROOT 6.14+ has corrected this error, and required target properties have been getting better. This method is rapidly becoming easier to use (see the example at the end of this page for the older ROOT details).\nTo link, just pick the libraries you want to use:\nadd_executable(RootSimpleExample SimpleExample.cxx)\ntarget_link_libraries(RootSimpleExample PUBLIC ROOT::Physics)\n\nIf you'd like to see the default list, run root-config --libs on the command line. In Homebrew ROOT 6.18 this would be:\n\nROOT::Core\nROOT::Gpad\nROOT::Graf3d\nROOT::Graf\nROOT::Hist\nROOT::Imt\nROOT::MathCore\nROOT::Matrix\nROOT::MultiProc\nROOT::Net\nROOT::Physics\nROOT::Postscript\nROOT::RIO\nROOT::ROOTDataFrame\nROOT::ROOTVecOps\nROOT::Rint\nROOT::Thread\nROOT::TreePlayer\nROOT::Tree\n\nThe old global way\nROOT provides a utility to set up a ROOT project, which you can activate using include(\"${ROOT_USE_FILE}\"). This will automatically make ugly directory level and global variables for you. It will save you a little time setting up, and will waste massive amounts of time later if you try to do anything tricky. As long as you aren't making a library, it's probably fine for simple scripts. Includes and flags are set globally, but you'll still need to link to ${ROOT_LIBRARIES} yourself, along with possibly ROOT_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS (You will have to separate_arguments first before linking or you will get an error if there are multiple flags, like on macOS). Also, before 6.16, you have to manually fix a bug in the spacing.\nHere's what it would look like:\n# Sets up global settings\ninclude(\"${ROOT_USE_FILE}\")\n\n# This is required for ROOT \nComponents\nFind ROOT allows you to specify components. It will add anything you list to ${ROOT_LIBRARIES}, so you might want to build your own target using that to avoid listing the components twice. This did not solve dependencies; it was an error to list RooFit but not RooFitCore. If you link to ROOT::RooFit instead of ${ROOT_LIBRARIES}, then RooFitCore is not required.\nDictionary generation\nDictionary generation is ROOT's way of working around the missing reflection feature in C++. It allows ROOT to learn the details of your class so it can save it, show methods in the Cling interpreter, etc. You'll need three things in your source code to make it work for classes:\n\nYour class definition should end with ClassDef(MyClassName, 1)\nYour class implementation should have ClassImp(MyClassName) in it\nYou should have a file with a name that ends with LinkDef.h\n\nThe LinkDef.h file follows a specific formula and tells ROOT what parts to generate dictionaries for.\nTo generate, you should include the following in your CMakeLists:\ninclude(\"${ROOT_DIR}/modules/RootNewMacros.cmake\")\n\n# Uncomment for ROOT versions than 6.16\n# They break if nothing is in the global include list!\n# include_directories(ROOT_BUG)\n\nThe second line is due to a bug in the NewMacros file that causes dictionary generation to fail if there is not at least one global include directory or a inc folder. Here I'm including a non-existent directory just to make it work. There is no ROOT_BUG directory.\nTo generate a file:\nroot_generate_dictionary(G__Example Example.h LINKDEF ExampleLinkDef.h)\n\nThe final argument, listed after LINKDEF, must have a name that ends in LinkDef.h. This command will create three files. If you started output name with G__, that will be removed from the name, otherwise it will use the name given; this must match the final output library name you will soon be creating.

This will cover recommended usages, as well as some aspects of the design.\nUsage\nMinuit2 can be used in any of the standard CMake ways, either from the ROOT source or from a standalone source distribution:\n# Check for Minuit2 in ROOT if you want\n# and then link to ROOT::Minuit2 instead\n\nadd_subdirectory(minuit2) # or root/math/minuit2\n# OR\nfind_package(Minuit2 CONFIG) # Either build or install\n\ntarget_link_libraries(MyProgram PRIVATE Minuit2::Minuit2)\n\nDevelopment\nMinuit2 is a good example of potential solutions to the problem of integrating a modern (CMake 3.1+) build into an existing framework.\nTo handle the two different CMake systems, the main CMakeLists.txt defines common options, then calls a Standalone.cmake file if this is not building as part of ROOT.\nThe hardest part in the ROOT case is that Minuit2 requires files that are outside the math/minuit2 directory. This was solved by adding a copy_standalone.cmake file with a function that takes a filename list and then either returns a list of filenames inplace in the original source, or copies files into the local source and returns a list of the new locations, or returns just the list of new locations if the original source does not exist (standalone).\n# Copies files into source directory\ncmake /root/math/minuit2 -Dminuit2-standalone=ON\n\n# Makes .tar.gz from source directory\nmake package_source\n\n# Optional, clean the source directory\nmake purge\n\nThis is only intended for developers wanting to produce source packages - a normal user does not pass this option and will not create source copies.\nYou can use make install or make package (binary packages) without adding this standalone option, either from inside the ROOT source or from a standalone package.\n"}}}
